# Mary's Magical Jumping (Adventure)
This is the repository for my modification of Facewaw's Hopping Bird game, the one you may stumble upon if you search for copyrighted characters on Google Play. Unlike those games, this will go further, with modified sound effects (from Mary's Magical Adventure) and brand new levels! Unlike those bootleggers, my "fork" of Hopping Bird will go further than they ever will.
# Compiling
Building this game (and the original Hopping Bird) is easy! Install Android Studio then import this repository's root folder into it. If you get any errors about missing Android target versions or build tools, install those then you will successfully compile the game!

In addition, testing any custom levels is very easy! Once you complete a level, the level select will let you choose it again, allowing easy testing of later level design tweaks.
